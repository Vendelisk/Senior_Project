The actual code of the server lives in /var/www/senior_project
everything should be there.

Mongodb is located at /usr/bin 
run: ./mongod to get the database up and running
run: ./mongodb to look at the data in the database. Look up the rest of the commands if using it

make you are connecting to the db via port 27017 to do this
just uncomment the mongoose connect close to line 20
and comment the other line that says mongoose connect
